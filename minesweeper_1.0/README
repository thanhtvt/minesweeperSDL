Minesweeper with no animation, no image, just code and number. 
RULES: 
- Type how many columns and rows you want to form your playground. (FIRST INPUT)
- Type how many mines you want to play with (SECOND INPUT)
- After that, you have to type the coordinate (in column - row order) that doesn't have mine in there.
- If you can successfully do that, the game continues. Else, GAME OVER!!!.

Last words: Have fun with my first ever so-called game project!
